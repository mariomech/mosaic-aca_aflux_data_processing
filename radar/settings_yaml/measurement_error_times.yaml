# During MOSAiC-ACA, MiRAC radar measurements are erroneous
# after most 89 GHz internal calibration cycles. These occur
# every 20-30 minutes.
# This file lists the manually identified times, where the
# mirac radar shows a defect signal. It is based on 30 min
# quicklooks of the raw Ze to identified defect signals,
# and the identified times of the calibration cycle. The
# calibration cycle time is detected from jumps in the 
# time stamp of >= 8 seconds in each MiRAC file.
# This file can be read as a dict using the python yaml 
# library.
# Only times between takeoff and landing are considered.

  comment: Error occurs during first calibration cycle after takeoff until end of file. Other files or OK.

  comment: Error occurs already on ground during 1st calibration cycle. Afterwards observations may be OK until 2nd calibration cycle. Also for the following file, measurements are erroneous. Therefore, entire flight is basically marked.

  comment: Sometimes, also stripes with higher Ze occur like at 2020-09-02 09:26:40. After 2020-09-02 10:20:52, no error can be found - maybe because there are no clouds? Observations are not marker here, because no suspicous patterns are found, but may be affected as well! During the end of the flight, pixels are nan randomly within a region with high Ze. This is not marked here as error.

  comment: First calibration seems to have no effect, but the second one causes error. Restarts after the second calibration do not solve the error. After second time, the error occurs, the calibration is turned off.
