# MOSAiC-ACA and AFLUX data processing scripts

The repository is a collection of scripts developed by the members of the institutes that conducted the AFLUX und MOSAiC-ACA airborne campaigns as part of the (AC)3 project <https://www.ac3-tr.de/>. The scripts are a supplement to the data publication "MOSAiC-ACA and AFLUX - Arctic airborne campaigns characterizing the exit area of MOSAiC" published in *Nature - Scientific Data* and have been used to create the data presented therein. 

Each instrument set has it's own directory that contains a separate README. In their the intention of the scripts and the responsible authors can be found. More details on the measurements and the processing can be found in the afore mentioned publication.

For further information on the overall repository contact Mario Mech - University of Cologne (mario.mech@uni-koeln.de).
