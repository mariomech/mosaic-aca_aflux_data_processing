# Radiometer processing

The included scripts (hatpro_processing.py, mirac-p_processing.py) read HATPRO/MiRAC-P data from netcdf format as recorded from Radiometer Physics GmbH standard radiometer software and convert theses to a format matching CF conventions.

For details check comments in scripts.
